# An Display of UFO Sightings
Help Dana create a webpage for UFO sightings.

## Overview of Project
Dana is looking to create a webpage that provides an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. 

## Results
Steps to use the search criteria:
1) Access the webpage.
2) In the 5 search boxes on the left hand side of the page, enter the criteria on which you would like to filter the data

3) Click anywhere on the screen to see your newly filtered table! (Below is filtered to show sightings from 1/13/2010)

Note: You can use multiple filters at once to create as granular of a table as you would like!

## Summary
Though this tool is powerful, it is difficult to know what options are even available and easy to quickly apply filters that result in an empty table. One option would be to have drop downs for the filters so that users have some idea of what options even exist in the underlying data. The filters are also case sensitive, so typing the state as 'CA' for example results in an empty table, and 'ca' results in quite a lengthy table. It would be good to add these notes to the user, or to make the filter able to read in values regardless of case.
